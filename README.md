# true-og

TrueOG is a 100% free and open source Minecraft server made as a successor to and expansion of OG:SMP Season 1. Inspired in part by the best of Hive Java and FateMC Factions. TrueOG is committed to maintaining an OG Minecraft experience for our players, while still embracing positive (not all) change.

The TrueOG Server bootstrap makes it *incredibly* easy to spin up your own server based on TrueOG's source code. It's easier than setting up Spigot, and it gives you a  complete, optimized base from which to build off of. We encourage forks to maintain the "OG" meta that TrueOG strives for, but the code is yours to do with as you wish. This is in part out of principle, and in part an act of rebellion against OG Network's refusal to share their code for OG:SMP Season 1, causing TrueOG to be built from scratch, resulting in a long development period. If you disagree with something TrueOG does, you can take the server in any direction you want using a fork.
