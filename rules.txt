TrueOG Official Rules:

Punishment lengths are not yet set in stone and are subject to the discretion of the staff team.


=-=-=-=-=-Banable Offenses:-=-=-=-=-=


Rule 1 - No Inappropriate Usernames
Do not join TrueOG with any username that contains words or phrases which could result in a mute if typed in chat. Inappropriate usernames will be permanently banned. Once you change the username back to something appropriate, you may appeal the ban.

Rule 2 - No Exploiting Bugs
Do not intentionally abuse a bug or glitch to gain an advantage over other players. This includes duping and abuse of staff privileges. You may use the previously discovered season 1 seed to find resources close to spawn, but no hunting of the new seed(s) is permitted.

Rule 3 - No Faking Evidence
If you knowingly report someone for an offense they did not commit, you will be permanently banned.

Rule 4 - No Bypassing Accountability
Don‚Äôt evade bans or mutes. This will result in your punishment being made permanent.

Rule 5 - No Stolen Accounts
You must have acquired your Minecraft account legitimately. If you are caught using an account stolen from a data leak or another player, you will be banned.

Rule 6 - No Staff Abuse
Do not maliciously insult or threaten staff.

Rule 7 - No Impersonation
Don‚Äôt attempt to trick any player into believing that you are someone you are not.

Rule 8 - No Doxxing
Do not reveal anyone‚Äôs personal information without their consent.

Rule 9 - No Lag Machines
Do not attempt to make the server unplayable for others. Your build will be discovered, deleted, and you will be banned.

Rule 10 - No Character Automation
Do not use baritone or any other mod that allows you to automate your character. This world is open to players only, not bots. (edited)

Rule 11 - No Stat Boosting
Do not use alt accounts or friends to farm for gains in kills or other statistics.

Rule 12 - Use the Community Marketplace Responsibly
Shops are mainly intended for selling, not storage. If the market is full, and your shop consists largely of non-sale blocks, you may be asked to change or remove your shop by a staff member. Here is an example of what not to do: https://true-og.net/bad-shop.png


=-=-=-=-=-Mutable Offenses:-=-=-=-=-=


Rule 13 - No Extreme Bigotry
TrueOG is not an anarchy server. While we are tolerant of swearing and trash talk, targeted hate speech against an individual for being in a marginalized group is unacceptable and will result in a mute.

Rule 14 - No Bypassing Chat Filters
Using Discord or special symbols to bypass your mute is not allowed. Circumvention of your mute will result in a longer mute.


Rule 15 - No IRL Death Threats
Do not wish death or physical harm upon another individual or you will be muted. To avoid being muted unintentionally, if you are threatening to kill somebody in game, phrase it unambiguously, for example ‚ÄúI am going to kill you in Minecraft‚Äù.


Rule 16 - No Spamming
Do not use excessive spam or caps in chat or you will be kicked. Repeated offenses will result in a mute.


Rule 17 - No Explicit Sexual Language
Do not discuss sexual topics or post pornography on the server. There are kids here. NSFW memes should be kept to fun-katÔ∏±üòπ, not posted in game.


Rule 18 - Limit Outside Advertising
Only advertise pages or servers you own. Only advertise in the server once every 30 minutes.


Rule 19 - No Phishing or Scamming
Don‚Äôt attempt to trick other members into revealing credentials. Posting malicious links will result in a permanent mute.


=-=-=-=-=-Discord Rules:-=-=-=-=-=


Rule 20 - Keep Voice Chat Legible
